# Inception-Paper

This is the git-hub respository for the inception paper for CEDIL.

The paper will be written in markdown, mostly by Syreen Hassan and Calum Davey. 

The challenge for collaboration is that co-authors will want to contribute to a Word document, and we need a method for turning the .md file into an output file with all of the references intact.
